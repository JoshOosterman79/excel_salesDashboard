Welcome to my simple Sales Dashboard!

1. As of opening the Excel file you can interactive with the slicers/Sidebars to play around with the Categories and also the Quarters.
2. This project also utilizies VBA/Module that allows you to interact with the Show Quantity/Show Total Sales which comes attached to the folder. You may need to allow your Operating System to trust the .xlsm file to have the button function running. You can simply view the Sales Dashboard regardless but will be showing only the Total Quantity or Total Sales.
3. Future improvements/updates will include a better design, more interactive features, and much more !
